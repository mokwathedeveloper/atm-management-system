## 📖 Overview

The **ATM Management System** is a C-based application designed to manage user accounts and transactions within an ATM environment. This project showcases the use of fundamental C programming concepts, data manipulation through file handling, memory management, and system-level features like pipes and child processes.

3. **View Account Details**
   - View details of a specific account using its ID.
   - Interest rates based on account type:
     - **Savings**: 7%
     - **Fixed01 (1 year)**: 4%
     - **Fixed02 (2 years)**: 5%
     - **Fixed03 (3 years)**: 8%
     - **Current**: No interest

4. **Make Transactions**
